            "{'article': 'LONDON, England (Reuters) -- Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe gains access to a reported £20 million ($41.1 million) fortune as he turns 18 on Monday, but he insists the money won\\'t cast a spell on him. Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter in \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" To the disappointment of gossip columnists around the world, the young actor says he has no plans to fritter his cash away on fast cars, drink and celebrity parties. \"I don\\'t plan to be one of those people who, as soon as they turn 18, suddenly buy themselves a massive sports car collection or something similar,\" he told an Australian interviewer earlier this month. \"I don\\'t think I\\'ll be particularly extravagant. \"The things I like buying are things that cost about 10 pounds -- books and CDs and DVDs.\" At 18, Radcliffe will be able to gamble in a casino, buy a drink in a pub or see the horror film \"Hostel: Part II,\" currently six places below his number one movie on the UK box office chart. Details of how he\\'ll mark his landmark birthday are under wraps. His agent and publicist had no comment on his plans. \"I\\'ll definitely have some sort of party,\" he said in an interview. \"Hopefully none of you will be reading about it.\" Radcliffe\\'s earnings from the first five Potter films have been held in a trust fund which he has not been able to touch. Despite his growing fame and riches, the actor says he is keeping his feet firmly on the ground. \"People are always looking to say \\'kid star goes off the rails,\\'\" he told reporters last month. \"But I try very hard not to go that way because it would be too easy for them.\" His latest outing as the boy wizard in \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" is breaking records on both sides of the Atlantic and he will reprise the role in the last two films.  Watch I-Reporter give her review of Potter\\'s latest » . There is life beyond Potter, however. The Londoner has filmed a TV movie called \"My Boy Jack,\" about author Rudyard Kipling and his son, due for release later this year. He will also appear in \"December Boys,\" an Australian film about four boys who escape an orphanage. Earlier this year, he made his stage debut playing a tortured teenager in Peter Shaffer\\'s \"Equus.\" Meanwhile, he is braced for even closer media scrutiny now that he\\'s legally an adult: \"I just think I\\'m going to be more sort of fair game,\" he told Reuters.

He was able to do this by using Shodan, a search engine for internet-connected devices.\\nMr Krebs reported that Kromtech initially said that 13 million customers' details had been exposed.\\nThat figure was removed from the firm's statement - a spokesman for Kromtech told the BBC it had included both \\\"active and non-active\\\" users.\\nMacKeeper is widely promoted on the web - including in prominent adverts on Ookla's Speedtest site - as a way to \\\"clean\\\" and \\\"protect\\\" Macintosh computers in order to help them run faster.\\nHowever, critics have claimed that the software can cause computers to slow down and crash, and can be problematic to remove.\\n\\\"There are no ways that the program itself can harm or de-stabilise the system as described by some sources,\\\" the Kromtech spokesman said.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1998,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Aberdeen made it 10 home league wins in a row with a slim victory over Inverness Caledonian Thistle.\",\n          \"Twitter has updated its rules to highlight it is taking a tougher stance against abuse.\",\n          \"Former captain Stuart Hooper has been named as Bath performance and player development director, with Andy Rock joining the club as academy manager.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"id\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2000,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"38571417\",\n          \"35198313\",\n          \"28381580\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"doc_length\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 286,\n        \"min\": 11,\n        \"max\": 2694,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 769,\n        \"samples\": [\n          66,\n          309,\n          1046\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"summary_length\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 5,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 55,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 41,\n        \"samples\": [\n          6,\n          28,\n          12\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

John \\\"Junior\\\" Gotti, seen in September 2006, has had three criminal trials end in mistrials. Gotti was among six people indicted by a Florida grand jury, said Robert O'Neill, U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Florida. The indictments were unsealed Tuesday with the arrest of five defendants, including Gotti, he said. Negotiations were under way for the surrender of the sixth person named in the indictment, O'Neill said. All six suspects were charged under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, a law used to target organized crime groups -- in this case, the Gambino crime family. Gotti appeared Tuesday afternoon before a judge, who ordered him held without bail. His attorney, Charles Carnesi, told reporters the charges against his client were baseless. \\\"I can guarantee you that this case will be based on people who have been convicted of various crimes who do not want to go to jail,\\\" Carnesi said outside the courthouse. \\\"Let's face it, they have the money, they have the resources, they have an army of agents and most of all they have the ability to go to people who are willing to lie and say, 'OK, here's the key. Here's the way out.' \\\"  Watch authorities talk about 'significant evidence' \\u00bb . The indictment alleges Gotti was involved in three slayings in New York City -- those of George Grosso, who died in December 1988 in Queens; Louis DiBono, killed in October 1990 in the parking garage of the former World Trade Center; and Bruce John Gotterup, slain in November 1991 at the Boardwalk at the Rockaways in Queens. Gotti is the first person charged in Grosso's death, which was listed as an unsolved homicide and was investigated with assistance from the New York Police Department's Cold Case Squad, O'Neill said in a written statement. Gotti is charged in one indictment, and the five others in another one. Watch Gotti being led away in handcuffs . Carnesi said he was surprised by the judge's decision to hold Gotti without bail. He said it would be his preference to keep Gotti in New York as long as possible \\\"so that we can maintain contact with him\\\" and suggested he enter his not-guilty plea by video to the Florida court. Gotti, 44, of Oyster Bay, New York, has served as an associate, soldier, captain and de facto boss in the organization, the indictment alleges, as well as a member of a captains' committee formed in the early 1990s to assist in the administration of the family. His co-defendants are John Burke, 47, a New York prison inmate; James Cadicamo, 33, of Tampa, Florida; David D'Arpino, 33, of Howard Beach, New York; Michael Finnerty, 43, of Oceanside, New York; and Guy Peden, 47, of Wantagh, New York. Burke and Peden are also accused of participating in the murder of Gotterup, according to authorities, and Burke and D'Arpino are charged in the death of John Gebert, who was killed in 1996 in Queens. In addition, Cadicamo is charged with conspiring to beat or kill a man named Michael Malone to prevent Malone's testimony in a case, and with retaliating against Malone for his cooperation with authorities. A number of cases culminated in the indictment, which names people in Florida and New York, the prosecutor said. \\\"I think what you have here is, you have the Gambino crime family reaching out to Tampa, Florida\\\" and \\\"trying to gain a foothold,\\\" he said. All six defendants face a maximum sentence of life in prison, authorities said. If convicted of the charges involving Malone, Cadicamo could face the death penalty. \\\"[Gambino crime family] enterprise members engaged in public acts and displays of violence -- shootings, stabbings, baseball bat beatings and murder -- designed to create and maintain fear and dread in others so that the GCF enterprise could defend and expand its unlawful dominion and influence in certain geographical areas,\\\" according to a statement issued by O'Neill's office. \\\"GCF enterprise members worked to establish and maintain GCF enterprise footholds, or operational bases, in various parts of the United States of America, specifically including the city of Tampa, Florida.\\\" The Gambino family also is accused of crimes including robbery, bribery, kidnapping, extortion, home invasions and money laundering, among others, authorities said. Members of the organization \\\"invested some of their criminal income for the acquisition of interests in other businesses,\\\" including window and glass businesses, valet parking businesses and bars or nightclubs, prosecutors allege. Carnesi questioned why, if Gotti is involved in drug trafficking and murder, informants such as Sammy \\\"The Bull\\\" Gravano have never suggested it. \\\"You can go down the line as to any of these individuals who made deals with the government. ... They don't know anything of this,\\\" he said. In late 2006, a third mistrial was declared in a federal racketeering case against Gotti. Charges against him included racketeering and extortion. Prosecutors said they would not retry Gotti, who was accused of ordering attacks on radio talk show host Curtis Sliwa after the Guardian Angels founder criticized Gotti's father on his radio show. Sliwa was shot three times but recovered and testified against Gotti. Asked Gotti's feelings on the newest charges, Carnesi said, \\\"He was very disappointed to have to go through all this again. You can imagine the toll it took on him and his family to have to fight three times in the course of a year, to feel that, OK, perhaps it's over ... because the government itself came to the conclusion, no more. It's very disheartening for him to be back here again.\\\" Gotti's father, who was nicknamed the \\\"Teflon Don\\\" because prosecutors had trouble making charges stick against him, died in prison in 2002 of throat cancer.

President Robert Mugabe gestures during a pre-election rally in Harare on Saturday. Tendai Biti, secretary general of the Movement for Democratic Change, said that leaked correspondence from the election commission showed it had asked the company that is printing paper ballots to make 9 million. However, the African country has an electorate of 5.7 million registered voters, he said. Also, 600,000 postal paper ballots were requested for soldiers and police officers, Biti said. Postal ballots are usually requested for civil servants serving abroad, and the total number of soldiers and police in Zimbabwe add up to no more than 50,000, he said. \\\"Remember, when they stole this election away from us the last time, they stole it with 350,000 votes,\\\" Biti said. \\\"Six hundred thousand is double insurance. They cannot win a free and fair election in this country.\\\" The elections are slated for Saturday. Mugabe survived a hotly contested presidential challenge from MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai in 2002 amid widespread accusations of vote rigging. The president's other challenger this time is former Finance Minister Simba Makoni, who recently announced his bid to unseat Mugabe and was promptly booted out of the ruling party. Last week, New York-based Human Rights Watch raised doubts about the elections, saying it was likely to be \\\"deeply flawed.\\\" \\\"As the elections near, all indications are that once again the people of Zimbabwe will not be able to freely exercise their civil and political rights and vote for the candidates of their choice,\\\" the nongovernmental organization said in a 48-page report. The elections are expected to provide Mugabe with the toughest challenge yet in his nearly 28 years of rule. The report said the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission was partisan toward the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front and had neither the expertise nor the resources to run the elections properly.  Watch Mugabe threaten to expel companies under British rule. \\u00bb . That report brought derision from a Zimbabwean official. \\\"What qualifies them to do what they're doing -- policing the world and Africa in particular?\\\" asked Wilbert Gwashavanhu, political consul at Zimbabwe's embassy in Washington. \\\"Why don't they go to America and oversee how America holds its own elections?\\\" he said. \\\"Come on, give me a break! You can't judge the elections before they are held.\\\" No matter the final outcome of the election, the international community may never find out whether the vote proved to be free and fair. Independent news organizations are banned from Zimbabwe, and there are no credible monitors in place. Since 1980, the 84-year-old Mugabe has been the country's only ruler. But his odds of winning this time may be handicapped by Zimbabwe's dire economic situation. The rate of inflation reported in January was 100,000 percent, and food and fuel are in short supply, the Human Rights Watch document said. With more than three in four Zimbabweans unemployed, few could afford such food and fuel anyway. The country's downward economic spiral began in 2000, when Mugabe sanctioned the violent seizure of commercial farms, turning some of the land over to insiders and cronies. For his part, Mugabe remains defiant, blaming his country's economic woes on the West. E-mail to a friend .

Antonio Trillanes said. The senator made the decision to give up after the military peppered the inside of the hotel with tear gas. Live pictures from inside the hotel showed reporters and rebel soldiers covering their faces. An armored personnel vehicle was also seen firing into the lobby of Manila's Peninsula hotel and later rammed through the front entrance of the building. \\\"The situation is contained within the Peninsula hotel, Philippine Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro told CNN. \\\"The perpetrators are in the process of being arrested.\\\" Those who held the hotel were shown being loaded into a Philippine National Police bus. Teodoro said no one was injured, but Associated Press reported that at least two people were injured. The standoff began hours earlier when a group led by Trillanes and Army Brig. Gen. Danilo Lim bolted from a court hearing on charges linked to a failed 2003 coup attempt.  Watch footage of troops storming the hotel in Manila \\u00bb . \\\"What happened, to me, was clearly either an attempted rebellion or an attempted coup d'etat,\\\" Teodoro said. Philippines military and police personnel had been surrounding the hotel, where the group was asking for President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo to step down. After Trillanes' announcement, soldiers milled around the outside of the hotel, but the scene had calmed noticeably. Arroyo had issued orders to the military and police in response to the seizure of the hotel, located in Manila's Makati financial district, journalist Adrian Addison told CNN. Few supporters of the rebels were visible around the Peninsula hotel, Addison said. Philippine authorities gave the rebel group until 2:30 p.m. (0630 GMT) to allow guests to leave the hotel, and until 3:00 p.m. (0700 GMT) to surrender, the ABS-CBN news service reported. Businessman Peter Parcel was caught in the middle of the hotel's takeover and subsequent tear-gassing.

That report brought derision from a Zimbabwean official. \\\"What qualifies them to do what they're doing -- policing the world and Africa in particular?\\\" asked Wilbert Gwashavanhu, political consul at Zimbabwe's embassy in Washington. \\\"Why don't they go to America and oversee how America holds its own elections?\\\" he said. \\\"Come on, give me a break! You can't judge the elections before they are held.\\\" No matter the final outcome of the election, the international community may never find out whether the vote proved to be free and fair. Independent news organizations are banned from Zimbabwe, and there are no credible monitors in place. Since 1980, the 84-year-old Mugabe has been the country's only ruler. But his odds of winning this time may be handicapped by Zimbabwe's dire economic situation. The rate of inflation reported in January was 100,000 percent, and food and fuel are in short supply, the Human Rights Watch document said. With more than three in four Zimbabweans unemployed, few could afford such food and fuel anyway. The country's downward economic spiral began in 2000, when Mugabe sanctioned the violent seizure of commercial farms, turning some of the land over to insiders and cronies. For his part, Mugabe remains defiant, blaming his country's economic woes on the West. E-mail to a friend . CNN's Saeed Ahmed contributed to this report.\",\n          \"Dramatically played out on live television, an opposition politician and rebel military officers surrendered to government forces after taking over a luxury hotel in Manila. \\\"We're going out for the sake of the safety of everybody,\\\" Philippines Sen. Antonio Trillanes said. The senator made the decision to give up after the military peppered the inside of the hotel with tear gas. Live pictures from inside the hotel showed reporters and rebel soldiers covering their faces. An armored personnel vehicle was also seen firing into the lobby of Manila's Peninsula hotel and later rammed through the front entrance of the building. \\\"The situation is contained within the Peninsula hotel, Philippine Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro told CNN. \\\"The perpetrators are in the process of being arrested.\\\" Those who held the hotel were shown being loaded into a Philippine National Police bus. Teodoro said no one was injured, but Associated Press reported that at least two people were injured. The standoff began hours earlier when a group led by Trillanes and Army Brig. Gen. Danilo Lim bolted from a court hearing on charges linked to a failed 2003 coup attempt.  Watch footage of troops storming the hotel in Manila  . \\\"What happened, to me, was clearly either an attempted rebellion or an attempted coup d'etat,\\\" Teodoro said. Philippines military and police personnel had been surrounding the hotel, where the group was asking for President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo to step down. After Trillanes' announcement, soldiers milled around the outside of the hotel, but the scene had calmed noticeably. Arroyo had issued orders to the military and police in response to the seizure of the hotel, located in Manila's Makati financial district, journalist Adrian Addison told CNN. Few supporters of the rebels were visible around the Peninsula hotel, Addison said. Philippine authorities gave the rebel group until 2:30 p.m. (0630 GMT) to allow guests to leave the hotel, and until 3:00 p.m. (0700 GMT) to surrender, the ABS-CBN news service reported. Businessman Peter Parcel was caught in the middle of the hotel's takeover and subsequent tear-gassing.  Listen to the eyewitness in the hotel describe what happened  . \\\"I couldn't see and couldn't breathe,\\\" he said, noting he faced \\\"at least 100 guns\\\" as he exited the hotel.

John \\\"Junior\\\" Gotti, seen in September 2006, has had three criminal trials end in mistrials. Gotti was among six people indicted by a Florida grand jury, said Robert O'Neill, U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Florida. The indictments were unsealed Tuesday with the arrest of five defendants, including Gotti, he said. Negotiations were under way for the surrender of the sixth person named in the indictment, O'Neill said. All six suspects were charged under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, a law used to target organized crime groups -- in this case, the Gambino crime family. Gotti appeared Tuesday afternoon before a judge, who ordered him held without bail. His attorney, Charles Carnesi, told reporters the charges against his client were baseless. \\\"I can guarantee you that this case will be based on people who have been convicted of various crimes who do not want to go to jail,\\\" Carnesi said outside the courthouse. \\\"Let's face it, they have the money, they have the resources, they have an army of agents and most of all they have the ability to go to people who are willing to lie and say, 'OK, here's the key. Here's the way out.' \\\"  Watch authorities talk about 'significant evidence' \\u00bb . The indictment alleges Gotti was involved in three slayings in New York City -- those of George Grosso, who died in December 1988 in Queens; Louis DiBono, killed in October 1990 in the parking garage of the former World Trade Center; and Bruce John Gotterup, slain in November 1991 at the Boardwalk at the Rockaways in Queens. Gotti is the first person charged in Grosso's death, which was listed as an unsolved homicide and was investigated with assistance from the New York Police Department's Cold Case Squad, O'Neill said in a written statement. Gotti is charged in one indictment, and the five others in another one. Watch Gotti being led away in handcuffs . Carnesi said he was surprised by the judge's decision to hold Gotti without bail. He said it would be his preference to keep Gotti in New York as long as possible \\\"so that we can maintain contact with him\\\" and suggested he enter his not-guilty plea by video to the Florida court. Gotti, 44, of Oyster Bay, New York, has served as an associate, soldier, captain and de facto boss in the organization, the indictment alleges, as well as a member of a captains' committee formed in the early 1990s to assist in the administration of the family. His co-defendants are John Burke, 47, a New York prison inmate; James Cadicamo, 33, of Tampa, Florida; David D'Arpino, 33, of Howard Beach, New York; Michael Finnerty, 43, of Oceanside, New York; and Guy Peden, 47, of Wantagh, New York. Burke and Peden are also accused of participating in the murder of Gotterup, according to authorities, and Burke and D'Arpino are charged in the death of John Gebert, who was killed in 1996 in Queens. In addition, Cadicamo is charged with conspiring to beat or kill a man named Michael Malone to prevent Malone's testimony in a case, and with retaliating against Malone for his cooperation with authorities. A number of cases culminated in the indictment, which names people in Florida and New York, the prosecutor said. \\\"I think what you have here is, you have the Gambino crime family reaching out to Tampa, Florida\\\" and \\\"trying to gain a foothold,\\\" he said. All six defendants face a maximum sentence of life in prison, authorities said. If convicted of the charges involving Malone, Cadicamo could face the death penalty. \\\"[Gambino crime family] enterprise members engaged in public acts and displays of violence -- shootings, stabbings, baseball bat beatings and murder -- designed to create and maintain fear and dread in others so that the GCF enterprise could defend and expand its unlawful dominion and influence in certain geographical areas,\\\" according to a statement issued by O'Neill's office. \\\"GCF enterprise members worked to establish and maintain GCF enterprise footholds, or operational bases, in various parts of the United States of America, specifically including the city of Tampa, Florida.\\\" The Gambino family also is accused of crimes including robbery, bribery, kidnapping, extortion, home invasions and money laundering, among others, authorities said. Members of the organization \\\"invested some of their criminal income for the acquisition of interests in other businesses,\\\" including window and glass businesses, valet parking businesses and bars or nightclubs, prosecutors allege. Carnesi questioned why, if Gotti is involved in drug trafficking and murder, informants such as Sammy \\\"The Bull\\\" Gravano have never suggested it. \\\"You can go down the line as to any of these individuals who made deals with the government. ... They don't know anything of this,\\\" he said. In late 2006, a third mistrial was declared in a federal racketeering case against Gotti. Charges against him included racketeering and extortion. Prosecutors said they would not retry Gotti, who was accused of ordering attacks on radio talk show host Curtis Sliwa after the Guardian Angels founder criticized Gotti's father on his radio show. Sliwa was shot three times but recovered and testified against Gotti. Asked Gotti's feelings on the newest charges, Carnesi said, \\\"He was very disappointed to have to go through all this again. You can imagine the toll it took on him and his family to have to fight three times in the course of a year, to feel that, OK, perhaps it's over ... because the government itself came to the conclusion, no more. It's very disheartening for him to be back here again.\\\" Gotti's father, who was nicknamed the \\\"Teflon Don\\\" because prosecutors had trouble making charges stick against him, died in prison in 2002 of throat cancer.

President Robert Mugabe gestures during a pre-election rally in Harare on Saturday. Tendai Biti, secretary general of the Movement for Democratic Change, said that leaked correspondence from the election commission showed it had asked the company that is printing paper ballots to make 9 million. However, the African country has an electorate of 5.7 million registered voters, he said. Also, 600,000 postal paper ballots were requested for soldiers and police officers, Biti said. Postal ballots are usually requested for civil servants serving abroad, and the total number of soldiers and police in Zimbabwe add up to no more than 50,000, he said. \\\"Remember, when they stole this election away from us the last time, they stole it with 350,000 votes,\\\" Biti said. \\\"Six hundred thousand is double insurance. They cannot win a free and fair election in this country.\\\" The elections are slated for Saturday. Mugabe survived a hotly contested presidential challenge from MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai in 2002 amid widespread accusations of vote rigging. The president's other challenger this time is former Finance Minister Simba Makoni, who recently announced his bid to unseat Mugabe and was promptly booted out of the ruling party. Last week, New York-based Human Rights Watch raised doubts about the elections, saying it was likely to be \\\"deeply flawed.\\\" \\\"As the elections near, all indications are that once again the people of Zimbabwe will not be able to freely exercise their civil and political rights and vote for the candidates of their choice,\\\" the nongovernmental organization said in a 48-page report. The elections are expected to provide Mugabe with the toughest challenge yet in his nearly 28 years of rule. The report said the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission was partisan toward the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front and had neither the expertise nor the resources to run the elections properly.  Watch Mugabe threaten to expel companies under British rule. \\u00bb . That report brought derision from a Zimbabwean official. \\\"What qualifies them to do what they're doing -- policing the world and Africa in particular?\\\" asked Wilbert Gwashavanhu, political consul at Zimbabwe's embassy in Washington. \\\"Why don't they go to America and oversee how America holds its own elections?\\\" he said. \\\"Come on, give me a break! You can't judge the elections before they are held.\\\" No matter the final outcome of the election, the international community may never find out whether the vote proved to be free and fair. Independent news organizations are banned from Zimbabwe, and there are no credible monitors in place. Since 1980, the 84-year-old Mugabe has been the country's only ruler. But his odds of winning this time may be handicapped by Zimbabwe's dire economic situation. The rate of inflation reported in January was 100,000 percent, and food and fuel are in short supply, the Human Rights Watch document said. With more than three in four Zimbabweans unemployed, few could afford such food and fuel anyway. The country's downward economic spiral began in 2000, when Mugabe sanctioned the violent seizure of commercial farms, turning some of the land over to insiders and cronies. For his part, Mugabe remains defiant, blaming his country's economic woes on the West. E-mail to a friend .

Antonio Trillanes said. The senator made the decision to give up after the military peppered the inside of the hotel with tear gas. Live pictures from inside the hotel showed reporters and rebel soldiers covering their faces. An armored personnel vehicle was also seen firing into the lobby of Manila's Peninsula hotel and later rammed through the front entrance of the building. \\\"The situation is contained within the Peninsula hotel, Philippine Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro told CNN. \\\"The perpetrators are in the process of being arrested.\\\" Those who held the hotel were shown being loaded into a Philippine National Police bus. Teodoro said no one was injured, but Associated Press reported that at least two people were injured. The standoff began hours earlier when a group led by Trillanes and Army Brig. Gen. Danilo Lim bolted from a court hearing on charges linked to a failed 2003 coup attempt.  Watch footage of troops storming the hotel in Manila \\u00bb . \\\"What happened, to me, was clearly either an attempted rebellion or an attempted coup d'etat,\\\" Teodoro said. Philippines military and police personnel had been surrounding the hotel, where the group was asking for President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo to step down. After Trillanes' announcement, soldiers milled around the outside of the hotel, but the scene had calmed noticeably. Arroyo had issued orders to the military and police in response to the seizure of the hotel, located in Manila's Makati financial district, journalist Adrian Addison told CNN. Few supporters of the rebels were visible around the Peninsula hotel, Addison said. Philippine authorities gave the rebel group until 2:30 p.m. (0630 GMT) to allow guests to leave the hotel, and until 3:00 p.m. (0700 GMT) to surrender, the ABS-CBN news service reported. Businessman Peter Parcel was caught in the middle of the hotel's takeover and subsequent tear-gassing.  Listen to the eyewitness in the hotel describe what happened \\u00bb . \\\"I couldn't see and couldn't breathe,\\\" he said, noting he faced \\\"at least 100 guns\\\" as he exited the hotel.

John \\\"Junior\\\" Gotti, seen in September 2006, has had three criminal trials end in mistrials. Gotti was among six people indicted by a Florida grand jury, said Robert O'Neill, U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Florida. The indictments were unsealed Tuesday with the arrest of five defendants, including Gotti, he said. Negotiations were under way for the surrender of the sixth person named in the indictment, O'Neill said. All six suspects were charged under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, a law used to target organized crime groups -- in this case, the Gambino crime family. Gotti appeared Tuesday afternoon before a judge, who ordered him held without bail. His attorney, Charles Carnesi, told reporters the charges against his client were baseless. \\\"I can guarantee you that this case will be based on people who have been convicted of various crimes who do not want to go to jail,\\\" Carnesi said outside the courthouse. \\\"Let's face it, they have the money, they have the resources, they have an army of agents and most of all they have the ability to go to people who are willing to lie and say, 'OK, here's the key. Here's the way out.' \\\"  Watch authorities talk about 'significant evidence'  . The indictment alleges Gotti was involved in three slayings in New York City -- those of George Grosso, who died in December 1988 in Queens; Louis DiBono, killed in October 1990 in the parking garage of the former World Trade Center; and Bruce John Gotterup, slain in November 1991 at the Boardwalk at the Rockaways in Queens. Gotti is the first person charged in Grosso's death, which was listed as an unsolved homicide and was investigated with assistance from the New York Police Department's Cold Case Squad, O'Neill said in a written statement. Gotti is charged in one indictment, and the five others in another one. Watch Gotti being led away in handcuffs . Carnesi said he was surprised by the judge's decision to hold Gotti without bail. He said it would be his preference to keep Gotti in New York as long as possible \\\"so that we can maintain contact with him\\\" and suggested he enter his not-guilty plea by video to the Florida court. Gotti, 44, of Oyster Bay, New York, has served as an associate, soldier, captain and de facto boss in the organization, the indictment alleges, as well as a member of a captains' committee formed in the early 1990s to assist in the administration of the family. His co-defendants are John Burke, 47, a New York prison inmate; James Cadicamo, 33, of Tampa, Florida; David D'Arpino, 33, of Howard Beach, New York; Michael Finnerty, 43, of Oceanside, New York; and Guy Peden, 47, of Wantagh, New York. Burke and Peden are also accused of participating in the murder of Gotterup, according to authorities, and Burke and D'Arpino are charged in the death of John Gebert, who was killed in 1996 in Queens. In addition, Cadicamo is charged with conspiring to beat or kill a man named Michael Malone to prevent Malone's testimony in a case, and with retaliating against Malone for his cooperation with authorities. A number of cases culminated in the indictment, which names people in Florida and New York, the prosecutor said. \\\"I think what you have here is, you have the Gambino crime family reaching out to Tampa, Florida\\\" and \\\"trying to gain a foothold,\\\" he said. All six defendants face a maximum sentence of life in prison, authorities said. If convicted of the charges involving Malone, Cadicamo could face the death penalty. \\\"[Gambino crime family] enterprise members engaged in public acts and displays of violence -- shootings, stabbings, baseball bat beatings and murder -- designed to create and maintain fear and dread in others so that the GCF enterprise could defend and expand its unlawful dominion and influence in certain geographical areas,\\\" according to a statement issued by O'Neill's office. \\\"GCF enterprise members worked to establish and maintain GCF enterprise footholds, or operational bases, in various parts of the United States of America, specifically including the city of Tampa, Florida.\\\" The Gambino family also is accused of crimes including robbery, bribery, kidnapping, extortion, home invasions and money laundering, among others, authorities said. Members of the organization \\\"invested some of their criminal income for the acquisition of interests in other businesses,\\\" including window and glass businesses, valet parking businesses and bars or nightclubs, prosecutors allege. Carnesi questioned why, if Gotti is involved in drug trafficking and murder, informants such as Sammy \\\"The Bull\\\" Gravano have never suggested it. \\\"You can go down the line as to any of these individuals who made deals with the government. ... They don't know anything of this,\\\" he said. In late 2006, a third mistrial was declared in a federal racketeering case against Gotti. Charges against him included racketeering and extortion. Prosecutors said they would not retry Gotti, who was accused of ordering attacks on radio talk show host Curtis Sliwa after the Guardian Angels founder criticized Gotti's father on his radio show. Sliwa was shot three times but recovered and testified against Gotti. Asked Gotti's feelings on the newest charges, Carnesi said, \\\"He was very disappointed to have to go through all this again. You can imagine the toll it took on him and his family to have to fight three times in the course of a year, to feel that, OK, perhaps it's over ... because the government itself came to the conclusion, no more. It's very disheartening for him to be back here again.\\\" Gotti's father, who was nicknamed the \\\"Teflon Don\\\" because prosecutors had trouble making charges stick against him, died in prison in 2002 of throat cancer.

President Robert Mugabe gestures during a pre-election rally in Harare on Saturday. Tendai Biti, secretary general of the Movement for Democratic Change, said that leaked correspondence from the election commission showed it had asked the company that is printing paper ballots to make 9 million. However, the African country has an electorate of 5.7 million registered voters, he said. Also, 600,000 postal paper ballots were requested for soldiers and police officers, Biti said. Postal ballots are usually requested for civil servants serving abroad, and the total number of soldiers and police in Zimbabwe add up to no more than 50,000, he said. \\\"Remember, when they stole this election away from us the last time, they stole it with 350,000 votes,\\\" Biti said. \\\"Six hundred thousand is double insurance. They cannot win a free and fair election in this country.\\\" The elections are slated for Saturday. Mugabe survived a hotly contested presidential challenge from MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai in 2002 amid widespread accusations of vote rigging. The president's other challenger this time is former Finance Minister Simba Makoni, who recently announced his bid to unseat Mugabe and was promptly booted out of the ruling party. Last week, New York-based Human Rights Watch raised doubts about the elections, saying it was likely to be \\\"deeply flawed.\\\" \\\"As the elections near, all indications are that once again the people of Zimbabwe will not be able to freely exercise their civil and political rights and vote for the candidates of their choice,\\\" the nongovernmental organization said in a 48-page report. The elections are expected to provide Mugabe with the toughest challenge yet in his nearly 28 years of rule. The report said the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission was partisan toward the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front and had neither the expertise nor the resources to run the elections properly.  Watch Mugabe threaten to expel companies under British rule.  . That report brought derision from a Zimbabwean official. \\\"What qualifies them to do what they're doing -- policing the world and Africa in particular?\\\" asked Wilbert Gwashavanhu, political consul at Zimbabwe's embassy in Washington. \\\"Why don't they go to America and oversee how America holds its own elections?\\\" he said. \\\"Come on, give me a break! You can't judge the elections before they are held.\\\" No matter the final outcome of the election, the international community may never find out whether the vote proved to be free and fair. Independent news organizations are banned from Zimbabwe, and there are no credible monitors in place. Since 1980, the 84-year-old Mugabe has been the country's only ruler. But his odds of winning this time may be handicapped by Zimbabwe's dire economic situation. The rate of inflation reported in January was 100,000 percent, and food and fuel are in short supply, the Human Rights Watch document said. With more than three in four Zimbabweans unemployed, few could afford such food and fuel anyway. The country's downward economic spiral began in 2000, when Mugabe sanctioned the violent seizure of commercial farms, turning some of the land over to insiders and cronies. For his part, Mugabe remains defiant, blaming his country's economic woes on the West. E-mail to a friend .

Antonio Trillanes said. The senator made the decision to give up after the military peppered the inside of the hotel with tear gas. Live pictures from inside the hotel showed reporters and rebel soldiers covering their faces. An armored personnel vehicle was also seen firing into the lobby of Manila's Peninsula hotel and later rammed through the front entrance of the building. \\\"The situation is contained within the Peninsula hotel, Philippine Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro told CNN. \\\"The perpetrators are in the process of being arrested.\\\" Those who held the hotel were shown being loaded into a Philippine National Police bus. Teodoro said no one was injured, but Associated Press reported that at least two people were injured. The standoff began hours earlier when a group led by Trillanes and Army Brig. Gen. Danilo Lim bolted from a court hearing on charges linked to a failed 2003 coup attempt.  Watch footage of troops storming the hotel in Manila  . \\\"What happened, to me, was clearly either an attempted rebellion or an attempted coup d'etat,\\\" Teodoro said. Philippines military and police personnel had been surrounding the hotel, where the group was asking for President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo to step down. After Trillanes' announcement, soldiers milled around the outside of the hotel, but the scene had calmed noticeably. Arroyo had issued orders to the military and police in response to the seizure of the hotel, located in Manila's Makati financial district, journalist Adrian Addison told CNN. Few supporters of the rebels were visible around the Peninsula hotel, Addison said. Philippine authorities gave the rebel group until 2:30 p.m. (0630 GMT) to allow guests to leave the hotel, and until 3:00 p.m. (0700 GMT) to surrender, the ABS-CBN news service reported. Businessman Peter Parcel was caught in the middle of the hotel's takeover and subsequent tear-gassing.  Listen to the eyewitness in the hotel describe what happened  . \\\"I couldn't see and couldn't breathe,\\\" he said, noting he faced \\\"at least 100 guns\\\" as he exited the hotel.

It was the first such attack into the city of Ashkelon since the two sides declared a cease-fire, the Israeli military said. This aerial view shows the power station and industrial zone of Ashkelon, Israel, in March of 2008. The missile fired from a Grad rocket launcher did not cause any injuries or damage in the coastal city, said a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces. Rockets fired from a Grad have a longer range than the crude, home-made Qassams that Palestinian militants in Gaza fire more frequently. Militants have used Grads to strike farther into Israel. Ashkelon lies 12 miles (19 km) north of Gaza. Israel and Hamas, the Islamic militant group that has ruled Gaza since 2007, declared separate, tentative cease-fires two weeks ago after more than three weeks of fighting in Gaza. Israel launched the attack on Hamas in Gaza on December 27 with the stated aim of ending rocket attacks on southern Israel. More than 1,300 Palestinians died and about 5,400 others were wounded. Thirteen Israelis, including 10 soldiers, were also killed in the fighting. Since the two sides declared a cease-fire on January 21, militants have sporadically fired rockets into Israel. Israel has responded with air strikes. CNN's Igor Krotov contributed to this report.\",\n          \"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- China has canceled or postponed several military exchanges with the U.S. in reaction to last week's announcement that the U.S. is selling weapons to Taiwan, a Defense Department spokesman said Monday. Apache attack helicopters are part of the $6.4 billion weapons deal between the U.S. and Taiwan. Officials announced last week an intention to sell $6.4 billion in arms to Taiwan, though the deal still needs to be approved by Congress. Maj. Stewart Upton said the sale does not violate the Taiwan Relations Act, which allows the United States to provide Taiwan with items for self-defense . Taiwan split from the Chinese mainland in 1949 and the United States has vowed to support them if China initiates an unprovoked attack. The arms deal comes at a time when the United States needs China in negotiations over Iran's and North Korea's nuclear programs. \\\"The Chinese reaction is unfortunate and results in missed opportunities,\\\" Upton said. \\\"We feel that the global security environment calls for U.S. and [Chinese] officials to maintain close relations to address common security challenges.\\\" The \\\"bilateral events\\\" China called off or postponed involve \\\"senior level visits and humanitarian assistance/disaster relief exchanges\\\" scheduled to happen by the end of November, he said. The Chinese ambassador was said to be on his way to the State Department Monday afternoon to protest the proposed weapons sale to Taiwan. One U.S. official said the tension with China will not affect the role China is playing in negotiations with Iran or North Korea over its nuclear program. The official declined to speak for attribution because of the sensitive diplomacy involved. The arms deal package includes a variety of U.S.-made weapons systems, including Patriot III anti-missile system, Apache attack helicopters, Harpoon missiles and Javelin anti-tank missiles.\",\n          \"(CNN) -- A Virginia judge on Tuesday approved an $11 million settlement from the state to the families of victims killed or injured in last year's Virginia Tech shootings. Parents of wounded Virginia Tech students comfort each other on Tuesday. The 24 victims included in the settlement were among the 32 killed by Seung-Hui Cho's April 16, 2007, shooting rampage.

Police said they initially believed the two had been involved in a romantic dispute, but later determined they were Cho's first victims. It was almost 9:30 a.m. before authorities sent an e-mail to students and staff notifying them of the shootings and warning them to be cautious. About 9:50 a.m., Cho, 23, began shooting people in Norris Hall, an engineering and classroom building. While criticizing the university response, the panel -- which included former Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge -- also said quicker action by school officials may not have made a difference. The report also noted that campus and state agencies might have taken a different approach to Cho had his middle- and high-school records followed him to Virginia Tech. Problems with Cho reportedly began to surface well before the shootings.

It was the first such attack into the city of Ashkelon since the two sides declared a cease-fire, the Israeli military said. This aerial view shows the power station and industrial zone of Ashkelon, Israel, in March of 2008. The missile fired from a Grad rocket launcher did not cause any injuries or damage in the coastal city, said a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces. Rockets fired from a Grad have a longer range than the crude, home-made Qassams that Palestinian militants in Gaza fire more frequently. Militants have used Grads to strike farther into Israel. Ashkelon lies 12 miles (19 km) north of Gaza. Israel and Hamas, the Islamic militant group that has ruled Gaza since 2007, declared separate, tentative cease-fires two weeks ago after more than three weeks of fighting in Gaza. Israel launched the attack on Hamas in Gaza on December 27 with the stated aim of ending rocket attacks on southern Israel. More than 1,300 Palestinians died and about 5,400 others were wounded. Thirteen Israelis, including 10 soldiers, were also killed in the fighting. Since the two sides declared a cease-fire on January 21, militants have sporadically fired rockets into Israel. Israel has responded with air strikes. CNN's Igor Krotov contributed to this report.\",\n          \"summarize: WASHINGTON (CNN) -- China has canceled or postponed several military exchanges with the U.S. in reaction to last week's announcement that the U.S. is selling weapons to Taiwan, a Defense Department spokesman said Monday. Apache attack helicopters are part of the $6.4 billion weapons deal between the U.S. and Taiwan. Officials announced last week an intention to sell $6.4 billion in arms to Taiwan, though the deal still needs to be approved by Congress. Maj. Stewart Upton said the sale does not violate the Taiwan Relations Act, which allows the United States to provide Taiwan with items for self-defense . Taiwan split from the Chinese mainland in 1949 and the United States has vowed to support them if China initiates an unprovoked attack. The arms deal comes at a time when the United States needs China in negotiations over Iran's and North Korea's nuclear programs. \\\"The Chinese reaction is unfortunate and results in missed opportunities,\\\" Upton said. \\\"We feel that the global security environment calls for U.S. and [Chinese] officials to maintain close relations to address common security challenges.\\\" The \\\"bilateral events\\\" China called off or postponed involve \\\"senior level visits and humanitarian assistance/disaster relief exchanges\\\" scheduled to happen by the end of November, he said. The Chinese ambassador was said to be on his way to the State Department Monday afternoon to protest the proposed weapons sale to Taiwan. One U.S. official said the tension with China will not affect the role China is playing in negotiations with Iran or North Korea over its nuclear program. The official declined to speak for attribution because of the sensitive diplomacy involved. The arms deal package includes a variety of U.S.-made weapons systems, including Patriot III anti-missile system, Apache attack helicopters, Harpoon missiles and Javelin anti-tank missiles.\",\n          \"summarize: (CNN) -- A Virginia judge on Tuesday approved an $11 million settlement from the state to the families of victims killed or injured in last year's Virginia Tech shootings.

If sides target him, that is a positive for us, because it shows how well he has been playing. \\\"We can't hide him. Wherever he plays, unless we get him a seat near the posts, he will be targeted, (as) he was against Ireland and Scotland. \\\"If they want to target him, he is good enough and strong enough to deal with that and he should take it as a compliment.\\\" Jenkins also says Biggar's Ospreys half-back partner Rhys Webb needs more game-time before he is considered for a Wales recall. Webb made his Ospreys comeback against Munster last Sunday after being out since September with a foot injury. But the scrum-half suffered a knock to the head which looks set to rule him out of the region's match against Edinburgh on Friday.\",\n          \"summarize: The 21-year-old has risen through the club's youth ranks and made his senior debut against Southampton in 2014. He has now made 53 league appearances for the League One side, with a single goal against Shrewsbury in April 2016. Thompson told the club website: \\\"I love it here. I love playing here. It's a great club and a great place to play your football. Long may it continue.\\\" Millwall, who are 10th in League One and five points outside the promotion play-off zone, host 12th-placed Walsall on Wednesday.\",\n          \"summarize: Australia-born Hewitt, 76, was convicted in South Africa in 2015 of two counts of rape and one of sexual assault on underage girls. Inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1992, he was suspended in 2012 and is the first member to be expelled.

A U.S. military panel reviews a detainee's case at Camp Cropper near Baghdad. Speaking in Arabic, Maj. Gen. Doug Stone on Wednesday reassured Iraqis about how the 25,000 detainees -- mostly Sunnis -- are treated after being taken into custody on suspicion of involvement in the insurgency. Stone described the detention system as \\\"open and transparent,\\\" saying it makes the detainees better citizens and helps break the cycle of violence and poverty in the country. Stone said detainees get free medical care equal to what he gets as a general, food and water made to Islamic standards, educational opportunities, jobs skills and contact with families. The U.S. detention centers -- at Camp Bucca near the southern port city of Basra and in Camp Cropper near Baghdad -- are political sore points for Sunnis, who make up 83 percent of the detainees held. The main Sunni political coalition -- the Iraqi Accord Front -- cited the centers as one reason for quitting the government during the summer. Last month, the U.S.-led coalition launched Operation Lion's Paw in which between 50 and 70 detainees would be released daily during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan after taking a pledge not to rejoin the insurgency against the Shiite-led government. \\\"This pledge is an Iraqi pledge, a pledge before an Iraqi judge, frequently with a family member present,\\\" Stone said. \\\"I am pleased to tell you that in the more 1,000 that have gone through this program and taken the pledge, not one has returned to threaten Iraqi or coalition forces.\\\" Stone said the releases would continue at the same pace beyond Ramadan. Stone's description seems a far cry from the Abu Ghraib prison operated by the U.S. military in the first years after the invasion. That prison was closed down and razed in the wake of an international scandal over prisoner abuse. \\\"There are no secrets that go on in detention,\\\" Stone said. \\\"Our facilities are open to inspection by any agency that we in the federal government believe is credible. These agencies are welcomed because they are windows for the world.\\\"  See what life's like inside Camp Cropper's walls \\u00bb . By the time of their release, \\\"detainees grow in terms of working in an inter-sectarian environment,\\\" he said. Each detainee has a chance to take classes up to a sixth-grade level, and high school classes are being planned, Stone said. About one-third -- or 8,000 -- are in school, with 7,000 having passed the fifth-grade level, he said. The 860 detainees who are 17 or younger are all in school, Stone said. The average stay for a detainee is 300 days, but some have been detained for two years or longer, he said. A review board interviews detainees to decide if they are a threat to security, he said. If they are deemed not to be, they are offered freedom in exchange for taking the pledge. Only 280 detainees are foreigners, mostly from Syria, Egypt, Iran, Sudan and Saudi Arabia, he said.

Real-life human anger even can spill over into Second Life, the online virtual world. But though they may be godlike online, they're still human in real life -- and like all humans, they can become victim to their emotions. \\\"I have been in many situations over the past two years in Second Life where people have been rude, overly aggressive, bullying me by tracking me down using my profile and flaming [me] with words or grief,\\\" said Anoron Hanson, a Second Life regular, in an e-mail interview. Rekka Berchot, another Second Life citizen, says she believes that people act differently in SL than they do in real life, or \\\"RL,\\\" as Second Lifers call it. \\\"You don't use filters as much in Second Life,\\\" she said. \\\"I find that there are things about yourself that come out in Second Life that [don't] in real life.\\\" If you are attacked in Second Life, she adds, there's little you can do besides file an abuse report; SL players can boot others off their sims, but the effect is generally temporary. Better, she says, is to control the other person through your own cleverness: freezing their avatar or muting their \\\"voices.\\\" (Berchot added that \\\"I've been known to use kung fu.\\\") iReport.com: Reduction in nonverbal communication leads to misunderstandings . But, in general, what works best is to try to understand the reason for the other's behavior, says Hanson. \\\"I believe one can try and assess their own behavior responsibly so when we encounter such individuals we are prepared for a response that will either calm the person or leave them disinterested and go about their business elsewhere,\\\" he said. \\\"[I] smile or laugh and tell them how clever they are for doing what they did.\\\" He says Second Life, in general, is a good life: \\\"Those who take the time to really find out how to live and thrive in SL safely and still have fun are the ones who will last the longest,\\\" he said. iReport.com: Jealousy and fantasy play out in a virtual world . He's philosophical about the game's occasional bad apples. \\\"There is nothing you can do about the flaming. It is here to stay. You have to remember that a great deal of us online are often ill or restricted in some way in their real lives,\\\" he observed. \\\"My point is, there is nothing you can do save to keep the rules in place and moderate the situation. It is a free country, just let the poor bastards vent their frustrations.\\\"\",\n          \"(CNN) -- Legendary singer/songwriter Aretha Franklin sang \\\"My Country 'Tis of Thee\\\" at the inauguration Tuesday. Aretha Franklin says cold weather affected her voice during her performance at the inauguration on Tuesday. CNN's Larry King talks with \\\"The Queen of Soul\\\" about the reality of the nation's first black president, singing at the inauguration and the much-talked-about hat she wore. Larry King: Where'd you get that hat? Aretha Franklin: Well, I bought it at a little millinery that I frequent out in Detroit. King: What was that like for you (Tuesday)? Franklin: Oh. What a tremendous, mammoth morning, evening, the ball, everything, from one event to the other, was just too much. King: How did you find out you were singing? Franklin: My agent called me and he told me that he had received an invitation and a telephone call, asking for my presence and performance at the swearing-in and the inauguration. King: Did you choose the song? Franklin: Yes, I did. King: Is that a tough song to sing? Franklin: No, not at all, but (Tuesday) it was. Mainly because of the temperature outside. I don't have to tell you, it was freezing, if you were there. Some singers it doesn't bother, and others it does. I don't care for it. It affected my voice.  Watch Franklin sing at inauguration \\u00bb . King: You sang at Martin Luther King's funeral. What do you remember about that? Franklin: There were very, very long lines, of course. I recall walking in the street behind the bier, somewhere maybe about 200, 300 feet from the bier, I think. I recall Leontyne Price being there, as well as Eartha Kitt. They shuttled us from one point to the other. The passing of a great man was at hand. King: How did you feel yesterday about seeing a young black man elected president? Franklin: Oh boy, how do you put it into words? There's a love affair going on with the country and Barack. I think it's the age of Barack. People have just fallen head over heels in love with him. His ascent to the presidency was miraculous. But we have to remember that he's not going to work miracles right off the top. It's going to take time.  Watch Franklin discuss joy of seeing nation's first black president \\u00bb . (There's) a lot of problems, and there's a plethora of things to deal with for he and his administration. King: One thing, with your magnificent voice, is it hard to sing outdoors? Franklin: It depends on the temperature. Yesterday, Mother Nature was not very kind to me. I'm going to deal with her when I get home. It, by no means, was my standard. I was not happy with it, but I just feel blessed because it could have been five above zero or five below zero like it is in Detroit. I was still blessed to be able to pretty much just sing the melody, but I wasn't happy with it, of course. King: It was great to listen to. Franklin: I was delighted and thrilled to be there. That was the most important thing, not so much the performance, but just to be there and to see this great man go into office -- the promise of tomorrow coming to pass.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"highlights\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 99,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"More than 1,000 freed detainees reportedly keep pledge not to rejoin insurgency .

By the time of their release, \\\"detainees grow in terms of working in an inter-sectarian environment,\\\" he said. Each detainee has a chance to take classes up to a sixth-grade level, and high school classes are being planned, Stone said. About one-third -- or 8,000 -- are in school, with 7,000 having passed the fifth-grade level, he said. The 860 detainees who are 17 or younger are all in school, Stone said. The average stay for a detainee is 300 days, but some have been detained for two years or longer, he said. A review board interviews detainees to decide if they are a threat to security, he said. If they are deemed not to be, they are offered freedom in exchange for taking the pledge. Only 280 detainees are foreigners, mostly from Syria, Egypt, Iran, Sudan and Saudi Arabia, he said. Other developments .\",\n          \"summarize: (CNN) -- Residents of Second Life, the online virtual environment, can do all kinds of things they can't in real life: fly, mute other voices, even transport themselves from one location (or \\\"sim\\\") to another. Real-life human anger even can spill over into Second Life, the online virtual world. But though they may be godlike online, they're still human in real life -- and like all humans, they can become victim to their emotions. \\\"I have been in many situations over the past two years in Second Life where people have been rude, overly aggressive, bullying me by tracking me down using my profile and flaming [me] with words or grief,\\\" said Anoron Hanson, a Second Life regular, in an e-mail interview. Rekka Berchot, another Second Life citizen, says she believes that people act differently in SL than they do in real life, or \\\"RL,\\\" as Second Lifers call it. \\\"You don't use filters as much in Second Life,\\\" she said. \\\"I find that there are things about yourself that come out in Second Life that [don't] in real life.\\\" If you are attacked in Second Life, she adds, there's little you can do besides file an abuse report; SL players can boot others off their sims, but the effect is generally temporary. Better, she says, is to control the other person through your own cleverness: freezing their avatar or muting their \\\"voices.\\\" (Berchot added that \\\"I've been known to use kung fu.\\\") iReport.com: Reduction in nonverbal communication leads to misunderstandings . But, in general, what works best is to try to understand the reason for the other's behavior, says Hanson. \\\"I believe one can try and assess their own behavior responsibly so when we encounter such individuals we are prepared for a response that will either calm the person or leave them disinterested and go about their business elsewhere,\\\" he said. \\\"[I] smile or laugh and tell them how clever they are for doing what they did.\\\" He says Second Life, in general, is a good life: \\\"Those who take the time to really find out how to live and thrive in SL safely and still have fun are the ones who will last the longest,\\\" he said. iReport.com: Jealousy and fantasy play out in a virtual world . He's philosophical about the game's occasional bad apples. \\\"There is nothing you can do about the flaming. It is here to stay. You have to remember that a great deal of us online are often ill or restricted in some way in their real lives,\\\" he observed. \\\"My point is, there is nothing you can do save to keep the rules in place and moderate the situation. It is a free country, just let the poor bastards vent their frustrations.\\\"\",\n          \"summarize: (CNN) -- Legendary singer/songwriter Aretha Franklin sang \\\"My Country 'Tis of Thee\\\" at the inauguration Tuesday. Aretha Franklin says cold weather affected her voice during her performance at the inauguration on Tuesday. CNN's Larry King talks with \\\"The Queen of Soul\\\" about the reality of the nation's first black president, singing at the inauguration and the much-talked-about hat she wore. Larry King: Where'd you get that hat? Aretha Franklin: Well, I bought it at a little millinery that I frequent out in Detroit. King: What was that like for you (Tuesday)? Franklin: Oh. What a tremendous, mammoth morning, evening, the ball, everything, from one event to the other, was just too much. King: How did you find out you were singing? Franklin: My agent called me and he told me that he had received an invitation and a telephone call, asking for my presence and performance at the swearing-in and the inauguration. King: Did you choose the song? Franklin: Yes, I did. King: Is that a tough song to sing? Franklin: No, not at all, but (Tuesday) it was. Mainly because of the temperature outside. I don't have to tell you, it was freezing, if you were there. Some singers it doesn't bother, and others it does. I don't care for it. It affected my voice.  Watch Franklin sing at inauguration \\u00bb . King: You sang at Martin Luther King's funeral. What do you remember about that? Franklin: There were very, very long lines, of course. I recall walking in the street behind the bier, somewhere maybe about 200, 300 feet from the bier, I think. I recall Leontyne Price being there, as well as Eartha Kitt. They shuttled us from one point to the other. The passing of a great man was at hand. King: How did you feel yesterday about seeing a young black man elected president? Franklin: Oh boy, how do you put it into words? There's a love affair going on with the country and Barack. I think it's the age of Barack. People have just fallen head over heels in love with him. His ascent to the presidency was miraculous. But we have to remember that he's not going to work miracles right off the top. It's going to take time.  Watch Franklin discuss joy of seeing nation's first black president \\u00bb . (There's) a lot of problems, and there's a plethora of things to deal with for he and his administration. King: One thing, with your magnificent voice, is it hard to sing outdoors? Franklin: It depends on the temperature. Yesterday, Mother Nature was not very kind to me. I'm going to deal with her when I get home. It, by no means, was my standard. I was not happy with it, but I just feel blessed because it could have been five above zero or five below zero like it is in Detroit. I was still blessed to be able to pretty much just sing the melody, but I wasn't happy with it, of course. King: It was great to listen to. Franklin: I was delighted and thrilled to be there. That was the most important thing, not so much the performance, but just to be there and to see this great man go into office -- the promise of tomorrow coming to pass.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"token_length\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 155,\n        \"min\": 515,\n        \"max\": 1018,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 90,\n        \"samples\": [\n          586,\n          802,\n          765\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"prediction_t5\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 99,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Maj.

She also used Facebook to mark herself safe on Saturday but this was the first time she had decided to use it.\\n\\\"Even though I lived in London for 17 years I didn't feel the need to use it previously because I wasn't directly involved and did not really link myself to what had happened,\\\" she said. \\\"But this time it was the quickest way to let my family know I was safe.\\n\\\"I remember during the 2005 bombings there was no such way to get in touch with people and there were problems with the phone lines too. It took a very long time to get in touch with my family in Italy.\\\"\\nSince the 7/7 London bombings, Ms Rota thinks that the growth of the internet and our use of Facebook has changed the way we view ourselves and others.\\n\\\"It can be a very positive thing but it can also be negative. it depends on whether we need to let people know we are safe or want people to ask us because we want to grab attention,\\\" she added.\\nJustin Trudeau kayaks over to say hello\\nIce hockey fans excused late work start\\nSimon Beech says he did think about letting friends know on Facebook that he was safe but ultimately decided not to because \\\"there was enough tragedy without me riding its coat-tails\\\".\\nHe said he knows that Facebook can enable people to be very kind to each other in times of severe turmoil with people offering taxi rides or accommodation to those caught up in the event.\\nHowever, he was also aware on Saturday that some people were taking the situation less seriously.\\n\\\"Somebody was offering accommodation in China and one man seemed to be well-known for always offering assistance as if to further his reputation,\\\" said Mr Beech.\\n\\\"One poor woman obviously felt that she needed to do something, but as she didn't live in London she offered a 'shoulder to cry on' which earned her a reasonable amount of scorn from other people,\\\" he added.\\n\\\"It could just be teenagers trolling too, I suppose. But you open yourself to the misgivings of others.\\\"\\nThe terrible loss of life and injury in the attack can not be overestimated but some Facebook users including Tariq Ahmed, chose not to mark themselves as safe because he felt it was magnifying the level of danger.\\nHe said: \\\"The threat of being killed in a car accident is much greater. Didn't want to contribute in he overexposure of the type of threat that is least likely to happen.\\\"\\nAnd for the same reason Amber Philipps said she marked herself safe but later questioned the decision adding: \\\"...actually marking myself 'safe' is almost making people  feel that being caught up in the attack is extremely likely\\\".\\nBy Annie Flury, UGC and Social News\",\n          \"Graham's The Family Dairy has revealed plans to build a new dairy, research and training facility at Craigforth.\\nThe 150,000 sq ft facility would include production lines for milk, cream, cheese and butter as well as a research centre for developing new products.\\nThe Graham family has been farming in Stirlingshire for five generations.\\nIt currently operates a dairy at Airthrey Kerse in Bridge of Allan, a processing plant in Nairn and depots throughout Scotland.\\nThe firm, which had a turnover of \\u00a385m in 2014, hopes to finance the new facility via a development of 600 houses, community amenities and a primary school on their land at Airthrey Kerse, which drew some local opposition and is currently awaiting planning permission from the council.\\nThe new centre would see 400 new jobs across sectors including processing, research, design, logistics, marketing, administration and management, as well as creating 50 apprenticeships locally.\\nIt could produce 350 million litres of milk every year, with the fast-expanding firm already churning out more than 700,000 pints a day.\\nRobert Graham, managing director of the dairy and grandson of its founder, said there was \\\"so much potential\\\" in the Scottish dairy industry.\\nHe said: \\\"Investing in Stirling runs through my family's history and our business. That is why we want to build the new dairy processing, research and training centre in Stirling.\\n\\\"Stirling is our home. It is where we farm, live and, from our dairy at Airthrey Kerse, employ more than 500 people throughout Scotland.\\n\\\"Stirling has the key attributes a business needs; a high quality education system, accessibility, dynamic business culture, an outstanding environment and an ambitious and inspiring city economic strategy.\\n\\\"Our research forecasts that by combining a new, modern dairy processing facility with a research and training centre that has strong links into the local education system and a proactive local recruitment policy, Graham's can significantly strengthen the Stirling economy and place the city at the forefront of the Scottish food and drink sector.\\\"\\nScottish government rural affairs, food and environment secretary Richard Lochhead said the dairy plan was \\\"fantastic news\\\" both for the industry and the local economy.\\nHe said: \\\"This is a real vote of confidence in the future of the Scottish dairy sector and I've no doubt this exciting project will help Graham's the family dairy cement their reputation as one of our leading dairy companies and brands.\\n\\\"I particularly welcome the development of new research and development facilities which will put Scotland at the forefront of developing innovative new dairy products and in the right place to respond to changes in consumer behaviour.\\\"\\nA planning application for the new dairy will be lodged with Stirling Council in June 2015, following a public consultation.\",\n          \"The EC's doubts about the arrangement were detailed in a document on Friday.\\nThe EC said that its \\\"preliminary view is that the tax ruling... by Luxembourg in favour of Amazon constitutes state aid.\\\"\\nHowever, Amazon said it \\\"has received no special tax treatment from Luxembourg\\\".\\n\\\"We are subject to the same tax laws as other companies operating here [in Luxembourg],\\\" it said.\\nThe Luxembourg finance ministry said: \\\"Luxembourg is confident that the state aid allegations in this case are without merit and will be able to convince the Commission of the legitimacy of the anticipatory decision in question and that no competitive advantage was granted,\\\" it said.\\nThe European Commission began a probe of the tax arrangement last year, saying that it had suspicions it broke EU rules.\\nThe Commission document, which was sent to the Luxembourg Ministry of Foreign Affairs in October, gives its rationale for launching the investigation.\\nThe Commission said it had \\\"no indication\\\" that the tax arrangement was \\\"compatible with the internal market\\\".\\nThe current European Commission chief, Jean-Claude Juncker, was prime minister of Luxembourg when the deal was struck.\\nMr Juncker has come under pressure over claims that around 340 global companies were granted tax  avoidance deals during his 18 year tenure in Luxembourg.\\nCommission doubts over the Amazon deal included whether Luxembourg had properly looked into Amazon's \\\"transfer pricing\\\" proposals about how money would be moved between different Amazon subsidiaries.\\nDoubts also existed about whether the country had assessed that the proposed tax regime was in line with market conditions before agreeing the deal in 2003, the European Commission document said.\\nThe Commission also had questions about how royalty payments between certain Amazon companies were calculated, and whether \\\"Amazon has a financial incentive to exaggerate the amount of the royalty\\\" between its Luxembourg head office company and an Amazon firm that holds shares in the head office company.\\n\\\"If the royalty is exaggerated, it would unduly reduce the tax paid by Amazon in Luxembourg by shifting profits to an untaxed entity from the perspective of corporate taxation,\\\" the EC said.\\nIt added that Luxembourg might have been too hasty in assessing Amazon's requested arrangement before striking the deal.\\nLuxembourg's finance ministry said it \\\"has provided all the information required by the Commission and cooperated fully with the Commission in its investigation.\\\"\\n\\\"Among other things, detailed reports on the transfer price requested by the Commission were disclosed,\\\" it added.\\nLuxembourg is also being investigated by the Commission over suspected \\\"sweetheart\\\" tax deals with the financing arm of carmaker Fiat.\\nIn addition, Ireland's tax deal with Apple and the Netherlands' arrangement with Starbucks are being scrutinised as part of a crackdown on multinationals' tax avoidance schemes.\"\n

of the attack in London at the weekend. For some, it offers an instant way to get in touch with people around the world in just one click but for others it can make them feel as if they are \\\"riding on the coat-tails\\\" of a tragic situation. Student Megan O'Hagan lives very close to Borough Market and London Bridge, and felt the safety check on Facebook was a very quick and easy way to let a large number of people know very quickly about her situation. \\\"I also find it useful to check on people I know in the area if I do not have their number or cannot contact them for whatever reason,\\\" she said, but also thought that it could be open to some misuse. \\\"Several of my friends from over two hours away marked themselves as safe but I think it should only be available to people that can confirm they are in the area, as no-one is wondering if someone who lives in Liverpool and hasn't been to London is safe in a terror attack in London!\\\" Italian psychologist Susanna Rota lives near London Bridge and was in the area when the attack happened. She also used Facebook to mark herself safe on Saturday but this was the first time she had decided to use it. \\\"Even though I lived in London for 17 years I didn't feel the need to use it previously because I wasn't directly involved and did not really link myself to what had happened,\\\" she said. \\\"But this time it was the quickest way to let my family know I was safe. \\\"I remember during the 2005 bombings there was no such way to get in touch with people and there were problems with the phone lines too. It took a very long time to get in touch with my family in Italy.\\\" Since the 7/7 London bombings, Ms Rota thinks that the growth of the internet and our use of Facebook has changed the way we view ourselves and others. \\\"It can be a very positive thing but it can also be negative. it depends on whether we need to let people know we are safe or want people to ask us because we want to grab attention,\\\" she added. Justin Trudeau kayaks over to say hello Ice hockey fans excused late work start Simon Beech says he did think about letting friends know on Facebook that he was safe but ultimately decided not to because \\\"there was enough tragedy without me riding its coat-tails\\\". He said he knows that Facebook can enable people to be very kind to each other in times of severe turmoil with people offering taxi rides or accommodation to those caught up in the event. However, he was also aware on Saturday that some people were taking the situation less seriously. \\\"Somebody was offering accommodation in China and one man seemed to be well-known for always offering assistance as if to further his reputation,\\\" said Mr Beech. \\\"One poor woman obviously felt that she needed to do something, but as she didn't live in London she offered a 'shoulder to cry on' which earned her a reasonable amount of scorn from other people,\\\" he added. \\\"It could just be teenagers trolling too, I suppose. But you open yourself to the misgivings of others.\\\" The terrible loss of life and injury in the attack can not be overestimated but some Facebook users including Tariq Ahmed, chose not to mark themselves as safe because he felt it was magnifying the level of danger. He said: \\\"The threat of being killed in a car accident is much greater. Didn't want to contribute in he overexposure of the type of threat that is least likely to happen.\\\" And for the same reason Amber Philipps said she marked herself safe but later questioned the decision adding: \\\"...actually marking myself 'safe' is almost making people  feel that being caught up in the attack is extremely likely\\\". By Annie Flury, UGC and Social News\",\n          \"summarize: Graham's The Family Dairy has revealed plans to build a new dairy, research and training facility at Craigforth. The 150,000 sq ft facility would include production lines for milk, cream, cheese and butter as well as a research centre for developing new products. The Graham family has been farming in Stirlingshire for five generations. It currently operates a dairy at Airthrey Kerse in Bridge of Allan, a processing plant in Nairn and depots throughout Scotland. The firm, which had a turnover of \\u00a385m in 2014, hopes to finance the new facility via a development of 600 houses, community amenities and a primary school on their land at Airthrey Kerse, which drew some local opposition and is currently awaiting planning permission from the council. The new centre would see 400 new jobs across sectors including processing, research, design, logistics, marketing, administration and management, as well as creating 50 apprenticeships locally. It could produce 350 million litres of milk every year, with the fast-expanding firm already churning out more than 700,000 pints a day. Robert Graham, managing director of the dairy and grandson of its founder, said there was \\\"so much potential\\\" in the Scottish dairy industry. He said: \\\"Investing in Stirling runs through my family's history and our business. That is why we want to build the new dairy processing, research and training centre in Stirling. \\\"Stirling is our home. It is where we farm, live and, from our dairy at Airthrey Kerse, employ more than 500 people throughout Scotland. \\\"Stirling has the key attributes a business needs; a high quality education system, accessibility, dynamic business culture, an outstanding environment and an ambitious and inspiring city economic strategy. \\\"Our research forecasts that by combining a new, modern dairy processing facility with a research and training centre that has strong links into the local education system and a proactive local recruitment policy, Graham's can significantly strengthen the Stirling economy and place the city at the forefront of the Scottish food and drink sector.\\\" Scottish government rural affairs, food and environment secretary Richard Lochhead said the dairy plan was \\\"fantastic news\\\" both for the industry and the local economy. He said: \\\"This is a real vote of confidence in the future of the Scottish dairy sector and I've no doubt this exciting project will help Graham's the family dairy cement their reputation as one of our leading dairy companies and brands. \\\"I particularly welcome the development of new research and development facilities which will put Scotland at the forefront of developing innovative new dairy products and in the right place to respond to changes in consumer behaviour.\\\" A planning application for the new dairy will be lodged with Stirling Council in June 2015, following a public consultation.\",\n          \"summarize: The EC's doubts about the arrangement were detailed in a document on Friday. The EC said that its \\\"preliminary view is that the tax ruling... by Luxembourg in favour of Amazon constitutes state aid.\\\" However, Amazon said it \\\"has received no special tax treatment from Luxembourg\\\". \\\"We are subject to the same tax laws as other companies operating here [in Luxembourg],\\\" it said. The Luxembourg finance ministry said: \\\"Luxembourg is confident that the state aid allegations in this case are without merit and will be able to convince the Commission of the legitimacy of the anticipatory decision in question and that no competitive advantage was granted,\\\" it said. The European Commission began a probe of the tax arrangement last year, saying that it had suspicions it broke EU rules. The Commission document, which was sent to the Luxembourg Ministry of Foreign Affairs in October, gives its rationale for launching the investigation. The Commission said it had \\\"no indication\\\" that the tax arrangement was \\\"compatible with the internal market\\\". The current European Commission chief, Jean-Claude Juncker, was prime minister of Luxembourg when the deal was struck. Mr Juncker has come under pressure over claims that around 340 global companies were granted tax  avoidance deals during his 18 year tenure in Luxembourg. Commission doubts over the Amazon deal included whether Luxembourg had properly looked into Amazon's \\\"transfer pricing\\\" proposals about how money would be moved between different Amazon subsidiaries. Doubts also existed about whether the country had assessed that the proposed tax regime was in line with market conditions before agreeing the deal in 2003, the European Commission document said. The Commission also had questions about how royalty payments between certain Amazon companies were calculated, and whether \\\"Amazon has a financial incentive to exaggerate the amount of the royalty\\\" between its Luxembourg head office company and an Amazon firm that holds shares in the head office company. \\\"If the royalty is exaggerated, it would unduly reduce the tax paid by Amazon in Luxembourg by shifting profits to an untaxed entity from the perspective of corporate taxation,\\\" the EC said. It added that Luxembourg might have been too hasty in assessing Amazon's requested arrangement before striking the deal. Luxembourg's finance ministry said it \\\"has provided all the information required by the Commission and cooperated fully with the Commission in its investigation.\\\" \\\"Among other things, detailed reports on the transfer price requested by the Commission were disclosed,\\\" it added. Luxembourg is also being investigated by the Commission over suspected \\\"sweetheart\\\" tax deals with the financing arm of carmaker Fiat. In addition, Ireland's tax deal with Apple and the Netherlands' arrangement with Starbucks are being scrutinised as part of a crackdown on multinationals' tax avoidance schemes.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"token_length\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 146,\n        \"min\": 516,\n        \"max\": 1023,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 91,\n        \"samples\": [\n          668,\n          725,\n          801\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"prediction_t5\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 100,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"It's a good idea to mark yourself as safe on Facebook, but it can also make you feel like you're being caught up in the aftermath of the attack in London.\",\n          \"A Stirlingshire family dairy has revealed plans to build a new centre for milk production and training.\",\n          \"The European Commission has said it is \\\"confident\\\" that Luxembourg's tax decision in favour of Amazon does not constitute state aid, the BBC has learned.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

It was the first such attack into the city of Ashkelon since the two sides declared a cease-fire, the Israeli military said. This aerial view shows the power station and industrial zone of Ashkelon, Israel, in March of 2008. The missile fired from a Grad rocket launcher did not cause any injuries or damage in the coastal city, said a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces. Rockets fired from a Grad have a longer range than the crude, home-made Qassams that Palestinian militants in Gaza fire more frequently. Militants have used Grads to strike farther into Israel. Ashkelon lies 12 miles (19 km) north of Gaza. Israel and Hamas, the Islamic militant group that has ruled Gaza since 2007, declared separate, tentative cease-fires two weeks ago after more than three weeks of fighting in Gaza. Israel launched the attack on Hamas in Gaza on December 27 with the stated aim of ending rocket attacks on southern Israel. More than 1,300 Palestinians died and about 5,400 others were wounded. Thirteen Israelis, including 10 soldiers, were also killed in the fighting. Since the two sides declared a cease-fire on January 21, militants have sporadically fired rockets into Israel. Israel has responded with air strikes.

Apache attack helicopters are part of the $6.4 billion weapons deal between the U.S. and Taiwan. Officials announced last week an intention to sell $6.4 billion in arms to Taiwan, though the deal still needs to be approved by Congress. Maj. Stewart Upton said the sale does not violate the Taiwan Relations Act, which allows the United States to provide Taiwan with items for self-defense . Taiwan split from the Chinese mainland in 1949 and the United States has vowed to support them if China initiates an unprovoked attack. The arms deal comes at a time when the United States needs China in negotiations over Iran's and North Korea's nuclear programs. \\\"The Chinese reaction is unfortunate and results in missed opportunities,\\\" Upton said. \\\"We feel that the global security environment calls for U.S. and [Chinese] officials to maintain close relations to address common security challenges.\\\" The \\\"bilateral events\\\" China called off or postponed involve \\\"senior level visits and humanitarian assistance/disaster relief exchanges\\\" scheduled to happen by the end of November, he said. The Chinese ambassador was said to be on his way to the State Department Monday afternoon to protest the proposed weapons sale to Taiwan. One U.S. official said the tension with China will not affect the role China is playing in negotiations with Iran or North Korea over its nuclear program. The official declined to speak for attribution because of the sensitive diplomacy involved. The arms deal package includes a variety of U.S.-made weapons systems, including Patriot III anti-missile system, Apache attack helicopters, Harpoon missiles and Javelin anti-tank missiles.\",\n          \"(CNN) -- A Virginia judge on Tuesday approved an $11 million settlement from the state to the families of victims killed or injured in last year's Virginia Tech shootings. Parents of wounded Virginia Tech students comfort each other on Tuesday. The 24 victims included in the settlement were among the 32 killed by Seung-Hui Cho's April 16, 2007, shooting rampage. The settlement also compensates 18 people injured. \\\"The commonwealth has endeavored to meet the needs and concerns of the victims, including family members, through both monetary and non-monetary provisions,\\\" said Chief Deputy Attorney General William C. Mims. Of the remaining eight deceased victims, families of two chose not to file claims and two other claims are unresolved. The other four will be brought forward at a later date, Mims said. The settlement also includes provisions that allow the families to occasionally meet with the governor and Virginia Tech officials to review legislation and improvements made at the campus in response to the tragedy. The families had pursued wrongful death and personal injury claims against the state after an August 2007 report by an independent panel concluded that more timely and more specific information from university officials might have saved lives. University officials were criticized for not immediately warning students and staff after two students were found dead in a dormitory at 7 a.m. on the day of the killings. Police said they initially believed the two had been involved in a romantic dispute, but later determined they were Cho's first victims. It was almost 9:30 a.m. before authorities sent an e-mail to students and staff notifying them of the shootings and warning them to be cautious. About 9:50 a.m., Cho, 23, began shooting people in Norris Hall, an engineering and classroom building. While criticizing the university response, the panel -- which included former Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge -- also said quicker action by school officials may not have made a difference. The report also noted that campus and state agencies might have taken a different approach to Cho had his middle- and high-school records followed him to Virginia Tech. Problems with Cho reportedly began to surface well before the shootings.

It was the first such attack into the city of Ashkelon since the two sides declared a cease-fire, the Israeli military said. This aerial view shows the power station and industrial zone of Ashkelon, Israel, in March of 2008. The missile fired from a Grad rocket launcher did not cause any injuries or damage in the coastal city, said a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces. Rockets fired from a Grad have a longer range than the crude, home-made Qassams that Palestinian militants in Gaza fire more frequently. Militants have used Grads to strike farther into Israel. Ashkelon lies 12 miles (19 km) north of Gaza. Israel and Hamas, the Islamic militant group that has ruled Gaza since 2007, declared separate, tentative cease-fires two weeks ago after more than three weeks of fighting in Gaza. Israel launched the attack on Hamas in Gaza on December 27 with the stated aim of ending rocket attacks on southern Israel. More than 1,300 Palestinians died and about 5,400 others were wounded. Thirteen Israelis, including 10 soldiers, were also killed in the fighting. Since the two sides declared a cease-fire on January 21, militants have sporadically fired rockets into Israel. Israel has responded with air strikes.

Officials announced last week an intention to sell $6.4 billion in arms to Taiwan, though the deal still needs to be approved by Congress. Maj. Stewart Upton said the sale does not violate the Taiwan Relations Act, which allows the United States to provide Taiwan with items for self-defense . Taiwan split from the Chinese mainland in 1949 and the United States has vowed to support them if China initiates an unprovoked attack. The arms deal comes at a time when the United States needs China in negotiations over Iran's and North Korea's nuclear programs. \\\"The Chinese reaction is unfortunate and results in missed opportunities,\\\" Upton said. \\\"We feel that the global security environment calls for U.S. and [Chinese] officials to maintain close relations to address common security challenges.\\\" The \\\"bilateral events\\\" China called off or postponed involve \\\"senior level visits and humanitarian assistance/disaster relief exchanges\\\" scheduled to happen by the end of November, he said.

It was the first such attack into the city of Ashkelon since the two sides declared a cease-fire, the Israeli military said. This aerial view shows the power station and industrial zone of Ashkelon, Israel, in March of 2008. The missile fired from a Grad rocket launcher did not cause any injuries or damage in the coastal city, said a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces. Rockets fired from a Grad have a longer range than the crude, home-made Qassams that Palestinian militants in Gaza fire more frequently. Militants have used Grads to strike farther into Israel. Ashkelon lies 12 miles (19 km) north of Gaza. Israel and Hamas, the Islamic militant group that has ruled Gaza since 2007, declared separate, tentative cease-fires two weeks ago after more than three weeks of fighting in Gaza. Israel launched the attack on Hamas in Gaza on December 27 with the stated aim of ending rocket attacks on southern Israel. More than 1,300 Palestinians died and about 5,400 others were wounded. Thirteen Israelis, including 10 soldiers, were also killed in the fighting. Since the two sides declared a cease-fire on January 21, militants have sporadically fired rockets into Israel. Israel has responded with air strikes.

Apache attack helicopters are part of the $6.4 billion weapons deal between the U.S. and Taiwan. Officials announced last week an intention to sell $6.4 billion in arms to Taiwan, though the deal still needs to be approved by Congress. Maj. Stewart Upton said the sale does not violate the Taiwan Relations Act, which allows the United States to provide Taiwan with items for self-defense . Taiwan split from the Chinese mainland in 1949 and the United States has vowed to support them if China initiates an unprovoked attack. The arms deal comes at a time when the United States needs China in negotiations over Iran's and North Korea's nuclear programs. \\\"The Chinese reaction is unfortunate and results in missed opportunities,\\\" Upton said. \\\"We feel that the global security environment calls for U.S. and [Chinese] officials to maintain close relations to address common security challenges.\\\" The \\\"bilateral events\\\" China called off or postponed involve \\\"senior level visits and humanitarian assistance/disaster relief exchanges\\\" scheduled to happen by the end of November, he said. The Chinese ambassador was said to be on his way to the State Department Monday afternoon to protest the proposed weapons sale to Taiwan. One U.S. official said the tension with China will not affect the role China is playing in negotiations with Iran or North Korea over its nuclear program. The official declined to speak for attribution because of the sensitive diplomacy involved. The arms deal package includes a variety of U.S.-made weapons systems, including Patriot III anti-missile system, Apache attack helicopters, Harpoon missiles and Javelin anti-tank missiles.\",\n          \"(CNN) -- A Virginia judge on Tuesday approved an $11 million settlement from the state to the families of victims killed or injured in last year's Virginia Tech shootings. Parents of wounded Virginia Tech students comfort each other on Tuesday. The 24 victims included in the settlement were among the 32 killed by Seung-Hui Cho's April 16, 2007, shooting rampage. The settlement also compensates 18 people injured. \\\"The commonwealth has endeavored to meet the needs and concerns of the victims, including family members, through both monetary and non-monetary provisions,\\\" said Chief Deputy Attorney General William C.

The settlement also includes provisions that allow the families to occasionally meet with the governor and Virginia Tech officials to review legislation and improvements made at the campus in response to the tragedy. The families had pursued wrongful death and personal injury claims against the state after an August 2007 report by an independent panel concluded that more timely and more specific information from university officials might have saved lives. University officials were criticized for not immediately warning students and staff after two students were found dead in a dormitory at 7 a.m. on the day of the killings. Police said they initially believed the two had been involved in a romantic dispute, but later determined they were Cho's first victims. It was almost 9:30 a.m. before authorities sent an e-mail to students and staff notifying them of the shootings and warning them to be cautious. About 9:50 a.m., Cho, 23, began shooting people in Norris Hall, an engineering and classroom building. While criticizing the university response, the panel -- which included former Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge -- also said quicker action by school officials may not have made a difference. The report also noted that campus and state agencies might have taken a different approach to Cho had his middle- and high-school records followed him to Virginia Tech.
